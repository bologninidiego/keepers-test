# Angular challenge for keepers

Hello, here you can find a code challenge that I've made on days 23/24 of january 2023.

Important things about the journey:
1. I've made it on 4h27min;
2. Componentize, code structure, state management, and behavior subjects were used;
3. Tried to speed up the coding by using some list/form components (ngx-datatable and angular forms);
4. The deal-detail method `buildForm` could be better if I have more time to build a hash based on `dealDetailDefs`;
5. The layout could be so more improve but the time was lacking.

So, to run up the project you'll need:

1. clone it
2. `npm install` (maybe a `--force` directive will be necessary)
3. `ng serve`
4. http://localhost:4200


The funcionalitys are:
1. Add a deal 
2. Edit a deal (by clicking on the pencil icon in each row)
3. Delete a deal (by clicking on the pencil icon in each row and pressing the "Delete" button)
4. Order the columns by clicking on the header
5. The cap rate is automatically calculated by changing the NOI/Purchase price.

Hope you'll enjoy it. Cheers :metal:
